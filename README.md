**Project Title:** **🩺 Liver Disease Stage Prediction Web App**
->A fully interactive, end-to-end machine learning web application built with Streamlit that predicts the stage of liver disease based on patient clinical data.
->This app supports rich visualizations, multi-model comparison, and real-time prediction using both uploaded data and manual input.

---

**📖 Project Overview:**
->This project aims to assist medical professionals and data scientists by providing a lightweight, intelligent tool to classify liver disease into stages using clinical features. 
->It supports:
              1.Uploading patient datasets
              2.Visual EDA to explore patterns
              3.Training 17+ classification models
              4.Evaluating model performance with metrics and charts
              5.Real-time prediction with form-based manual input

**📁 Expected Dataset Format**
Your dataset should include the following columns:
Categorical: Sex, Drug, Edema, Ascites, Hepatomegaly, Spiders
Numerical: Bilirubin, Copper, Cholesterol, etc.
Target: Stage (1, 2, 3, or 4)
Missing values are auto-handled. Label encoding is internally applied.

**⚡ Quick Working of My Web App (All Buttons & Actions)**
1.📂 Upload CSV
     Upload your liver dataset (in .csv/Excel format).
     The app reads and previews the data instantly.

2.📊 EDA (Expanders)
      “Show Distribution Plots”
      → Shows histograms + boxplots for all numeric features.
      “Show Pie Charts for Categorical Features”
      → Displays pie charts for Stage, Sex, Drug, Ascites, etc.

3.🤖 Model Selection (Dropdown)
     Select any one model from 17+ ML classifiers like: SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

4.🧠 Train and Evaluate (Button)
      Trains the selected model using the preprocessed dataset.
      After training, the app shows:Classification report
                                    Confusion matrix heatmap
                                    Accuracy
                                    Feature importance (for tree models only)

5.📥 Manual Prediction (Expander)
      Fill out the form with patient values manually.
      Click “Predict on Manual Input”:The app uses the trained model to predict the Stage of liver disease for that input.
